    "# Concordia Calendar Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook goes through the Calendar example and is a good place to start in order to gain a better understanding of the library and agent/game master interactions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since getting a PR merged to fix bugs in this example, I've continued working on updating the phone components for the Mastodon simulation. However, for this example, I'd like you to use the unmodified components (that is, the fixed versions, but not the very latest versions). This worthwhile in order to understand design decisions for the Mastodon sim updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, you may compare versions:\n",
    "- [Concordia mainline phone components](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/tree/2684366df2e70993bccb2ea3630cbe7cc7d91a7a/examples/phone/components)\n",
    "- [Latest updates for Mastodon sim](https://github.com/social-sandbox/mastodon-sim/tree/main/src/mastodon_sim/concordia/components)\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we can start by cloning the mainline repository, in order to be able to import the `examples/phone` components.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, I'd suggest that before you clear the contents of this notebook, you read through them, and see if you can understand how the main run cell's output aligns with the \"Analyzing this episode\" section below it."

Since one of the main Game Master's components is a [`PhoneTriggeringComponent`](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L33), this component [runs its `update_after_event` method](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L144).\n",
    "6. The `PhoneTriggeringComponent`'s [`_get_player_using_phone(event_statement)` method is run](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L111). This does the following, step by step:\n",
    "    1. Checks if the event_statement is a phone event ([prompt](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L59)). If False, returns None, which tells the GM to proceed to the next step in the overall episode.\n",
    "    2. If True, starts iterating through each player the main Game Master has access to (both in this case), [checking if the phone event is related to that player](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L120C19-L120C41) [(prompt)](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L89). If False, moves to next player. If out of players, moves does not continue with phone scene and instead moves to next step.\n",
    "    3. Once it hits one that is True, returns that player\n",
    "7. Since the above process affirmed phone event and player being Alice, [`self._run_phone_scene(player)` is run](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L147C7-L147C36).\n",
    "8. The phone scene starts by [building a PhoneGameMaster](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L129), providing it the single player that triggered the scene (instead of both players that the main Game Master has access to), as well as a [single component](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/scene.py#L72), [`_PhoneComponent`](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/scene.py#L79).\n",
    "9. The clock is then switched to a \"higher gear\", so the time intervals switch from 15mins to 10sec.\n",
    "10. The phone Game Master [calls its `run_episode` method]([phone_scene.run_episode()](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/\n",
    "53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/triggering.py#L137)) to start a scene in the \"phone universe\".\n",
    "11. The run episode method is the same method defined for the main Game Master, which proceeds to call `.step()` multiple times unless a component's `terminate_episode` method returns True at the end of a step.\n",
    "12. In the first step for the phone Game Master, similar to step (2), for the only player (Alice), an LLM is given this player's components' states plus a new [phone call to action](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/scene.py#L33) as a prompt. This prompt asks the LLM to says, \"What action is {name} currently performing or has just performed with their smartphone to best achieve their goal? ...\"\n",
    "13. This action attempt is passed through a [null thought chain](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/concordia/thought_chains/thought_chains.py#L28) to remain as-is, which becomes the resulting `event_statement`.\n",
    "14. The `update_after_event` method is called on each of the phone Game Master's components (though it only has the one, `_PhoneComponent`))\n",
    "15. `update_after_event` runs from the `_PhoneComponent`, which proceeds through a series of steps in order to determine which phone action to invoke:\n",
    "    1. First, it [asks which app the event statement mentions](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/scene.py#L115) (multiple-choice question: \"In the above transcript, what app did the user use?\")\n",
    "    2. Next, it asks [which of the available actions in the above app was used](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/scene.py#L122): (multiple-choice question: \"In the above transcript, what action did the user perform?\")\n",
    "    3. Next, it [asks the LLM to provide arguments names and values for the selected action](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/scene.py#L130) (open-ended question: [prompt](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/apps.py#L113))\n",
    "    4. Finally, it [attempts to invoke the action](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/scene.py#L133) with the generated argument values.\n",
    "16. After `update_after_event` is run for the phone Game Master's components, `terminate_episode` method checks are run. The `_PhoneComponent`'s check [asks the following yes or no question](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia/blob/53697b2bf2019b4a167bdd1f82d14e085f1a5eba/examples/phone/components/scene.py#L100): \"Has the user achieved their goal with their phone or are they still actively in the process of completing a phone task?\", which in this case returns True.\n",
    "17. The terminate episode check decides to terminate the ongoing phone game master episode, so it ends after 1 step.\n",
    "18. The main game master can now finally move on to its second step."

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />General knowledge of Riverbend: There is a hamlet named Riverbend. Riverbend is an idyllic rural town. The river Solripple runs through the village of Riverbend. The Solripple is a mighty river. Riverbend has a temperate climate. Riverbend has a main street.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />General knowledge of Riverbend: There is a hamlet named Riverbend.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />General knowledge of Riverbend: There is a hamlet named Riverbend.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

       "<div id=\"Alice\" class=\"tabcontent\">Summary:<br />Alice&#x27;s journey from a spirited child to a dedicated community leader in the idyllic hamlet of Riverbend is a tale of growth, resilience, and unwavering commitment to her town.\n",
       "\n",
       "At six years old, Alice took her first steps towards independence by walking alone to the grocery store to buy milk for her mother. This small adventure, filled with pride and excitement, connected her to the community as she chatted with Mr. Thompson, the friendly shopkeeper. By nine, she had organized her first event—a lemonade stand with friends to raise money for new library books. This experience ignited her passion for community involvement and event planning.\n",
       "\n",
       "At thirteen, Alice faced a challenging school project, naturally assuming the role of leader. Her ability to mediate and listen helped her team succeed, reinforcing her leadership skills. Three years later, she experienced a bittersweet moment when her best friend Emily moved away. Alice threw a memorable farewell party, showcasing her ability to find joy even in difficult times.\n",
       "\n",
       "Returning to Riverbend at nineteen after her first year of college, Alice spent her days helping on the family farm and organizing successful town hall meetings. This period reaffirmed her love for her hometown and her desire to contribute to its well-being. At twenty-one, she graduated with a degree in education and began her teaching career in Riverbend, feeling a profound sense of fulfillment.\n",
       "\n",
       "Two years later, Alice organized a large community event to celebrate Riverbend’s 50th anniversary. This experience solidified her reputation as a dedicated community leader.

       "As she reviewed her notes for the day, Alice felt a deep sense of gratitude for the community that had shaped her. Her love for Riverbend and its people continued to drive her, ensuring she remained a pillar of support and leadership in the town she cherished.<br />Memories:<br />[03 Jul 1990 00:00:00] When Alice was 6 years old, she experienced her first taste of independence by walking alone to the grocery store to buy milk for her mother. She felt a sense of pride and excitement as she chatted with Mr. Thompson, the friendly shopkeeper, who always had a joke ready for her. This small adventure made her feel grown-up and more connected to the community.  <br />[03 Jul 1993 00:00:00]   At 9 years old, Alice organized her first small event—a lemonade stand with her friends to raise money for new books at the library. She delighted in drawing colorful signs and engaging passersby with her cheerful demeanor, feeling a deep sense of accomplishment when they reached their goal. This experience ignited her passion for community involvement and event planning.  <br />[03 Jul 1997 00:00:00]   When Alice was 13, she faced a challenging group project in school where she naturally took on the role of leader. Despite some initial disagreements among her classmates, her ability to listen and mediate helped the group succeed. This episode reinforced her leadership skills and her belief in the importance of collaboration.  <br />[03 Jul 2000 00:00:00]   At 16, Alice experienced a bittersweet moment when her best friend, Emily, moved away from Riverbend. Though she was heartbroken, Alice threw a memorable farewell party at The Sundrop Saloon, showcasing her ability to find joy even in difficult times. This event deepened her appreciation for the close-knit community and the bonds she shared with her friends.  <br />[03 Jul 2003 00:00:00]   When Alice was 19, she returned to Riverbend for the summer after her first year at college. She spent her days helping her parents on the farm and her evenings organizing a series of successful town hall meetings at The Sundrop Saloon. This period reaffirmed her love for her hometown and her desire to contribute to its well-being.  <br />[03 Jul 2005 00:00:00]   At 21, Alice graduated with a degree in education and was offered a teaching position at the local school in Riverbend. She felt a profound sense of fulfillment as she stepped into her classroom for the first time, knowing she was about to embark on a journey that combined her passion for education and her commitment to her community. This milestone marked the beginning of her career as a beloved schoolteacher.  <br />[03 Jul 2007 00:00:00]   When Alice was 23, she organized a large community event to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Riverbend’s founding. The event included a parade, music performances, and a historical exhibit at the library, all of which she meticulously planned and executed. This experience solidified her reputation as a dedicated and capable community leader, strengthening her ties to the town she loved.<br />[01 Oct 2024 08:00:00] There is a pub on Main street Riverbend called The Sundrop Saloon.<br />[01 Oct 2024 08:00:00] The river Solripple runs through the village of Riverbend.<br />[01 Oct 2024 08:00:00] The Solripple is a mighty river.<br />[01 Oct 2024 08:00:00] Riverbend has a temperate climate.<br />[01 Oct 2024 08:00:00] Riverbend has a main street.<br />[01 Oct 2024 08:00:00] There is a guitar store on Main street Riverbend.<br />[01 Oct 2024 08:00:00] There is a grocery store on Main street Riverbend.<br />[01 Oct 2024 08:00:00] Riverbend has only one pub.<br />[01 Oct 2024 08:00:00] There is a library on Main street Riverbend.<br />[01 Oct 2024 08:00:00] Riverbend is an idyllic rural town.<br />[01 Oct 2024 08:00:00] Riverbend does not have a park<br />[01 Oct 2024 08:00:00] The main crop grown on the farms near Riverbend is alfalfa.<br />[01 Oct 2024 08:00:00] Farms near Riverbend depend on water from the Solripple river.<br />[01 Oct 2024 08:00:00] There is no need to register in advance to be on the ballot.<br />[01 Oct 2024 08:00:00] Riverbend is an idyllic rural hamlet with a temperate climate, centered around the mighty Solripple river.

Can you think back and tell me if you concretely remember doing that action this morning? If you did, what exact time did you do it? And if not, that's okay too - I just want to make sure we're clear on whether it's been scheduled or if it's still on your to-do list.\n",
