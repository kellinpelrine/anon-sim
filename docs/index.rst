Mastodon Social Simulation
==========================

Welcome to the documentation for the Mastodon Social Simulation project. This project provides a generative agent simulation of a Mastodon social network.

Overview
--------

The Mastodon Social Simulation is designed to model and simulate the behavior of users on a Mastodon social network instance.

Key Features
------------

- Generative agent modeling of Mastodon users
- Simulation of post creation, following, liking, boosting, etc.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with the Mastodon Social Simulation:

1. Check out the :doc:`installation` to set up the project.
2. Read through the :doc:`usage` to learn how to run simulations.

Use Cases
---------

The Mastodon Social Simulation can be useful for:

- **Misinformation Research**: Analyze the spread of information and misinformation in decentralized networks, and test the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies.
- **Social Network Dynamics**: Study user behavior, content diffusion, and the formation of communities in decentralized social media environments.
